# Coding Standards

## Environment Handling
- Account for different environments: dev, test, and prod
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Don't hardcode environment-specific values
- No mocking data in production code
- No stubbing or fake data patterns in dev or prod

## Code Cleanliness
- Avoid duplication of code
- Reuse existing functionality when possible
- Remove commented-out code
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Error Handling
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use try/catch blocks appropriately
- Log errors properly
- Handle edge cases
- Provide user-friendly error messages


## Refactoring Guidelines
- Avoid introducing new patterns without exhausting existing options
- Remove old implementations when introducing new patterns
- Keep the codebase clean and organized
- Document complex logic

## Security Practices
- Validate user inputs
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Protect against common vulnerabilities
- Don't expose sensitive information
- Follow security best practices
