# AI-Assisted Development

## Workflow Guidelines
- Always do one step at a time
- Ask for validation before continuing with the next step
- Make small, incremental changes
- Follow a clear plan for implementation

## Planning
- Always follow a structured plan
- If no plan is provided, remind the user to create one
- Plans should be structured in the `/plans` folder
- Each plan should include both a plan document and a checklist

## Testing
- Always test your code
- Add unit tests for new code
- Run unit tests after finishing your work
- Run the eslint check after finishing your work
- Ensure no previous features are broken by your changes
- Follow the instructions in [TESTING.md](mdc:TESTING.md)

## Code Review
- Document your changes clearly
- Explain the reasoning behind implementation choices
- Note any architectural decisions
- Highlight potential areas for future improvement

## Best Practices
- Document complex functions and components
- Verify changes against requirements
- Consider edge cases
- Include error handling
- Focus on maintainability
- Consider performance implications
- Follow security best practices
- Use bun as the package manager and to run the app, linter and the tests.

## Communication
- Be clear and concise in your explanations
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous
- Provide options when multiple approaches are viable
- Explain trade-offs between different solutions
